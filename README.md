## Overview
Brown Marketplace is designed as a convenient local transaction platform for Brown community members (users authorized through Brown emails), helping the student buyers and sellers to establish connections. The users could search for, bookmark, sell, and purchase products from fellow community members, and receive personalized recommendations. 

## Problem & User
The website is intended for personal use for Brown students and faculty members, who are looking to sell or buy second-hand belongings within the Providence area. The app not only provides a convenient, secure transaction way to trusted buyers and sellers, but also seeks to eliminate environment impacts by promoting second-hand goods reuse.

## Reflection & Futuer Development
This is a valuable learning experience for us in terms of designing and developing user-oriented project. We also wish to implement the following features if time permits: 

1. Support direct chat between users. 
2. Upgrade the recommendation system using machine learning and natural language processing models. 
3. Incorporate payment APIs for completing transactions.
